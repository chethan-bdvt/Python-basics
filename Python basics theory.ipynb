It is necessary for performing arithmatic operation, data manipulation  and input/output operation in Python programs.\n","\n","10.What is implicit and explicit type casting?\n","--> •An implicit type conversion is process of which the data type converts to another without programmers interventions.\n","    • An explicit type conversion is process of which the data type converts to another by programmers intervension using built in functions.\n","\n","11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","--> A conditional in python are used to execute the code based on outcome of logical expresion such as if, else,esif.\n","\n","12.How does elif statement work?\n","--> An elif statement allows to check multiple conditions sequentially. If the initial if condition is false, elif statements are evaluted untill true condition is found and the correspondence block is exicuted.If none of the elif block are true than else block will be executed.\n","\n","13.What is the difference between for and while loop?\n","--> \"for\" loop are used for iterating over a sequence of element. while \"while\" block is a infinite loop, It will keep on executing until the condition is true.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","--> A while loop is more suitable when number of iteration is unknown, and loop's continuation depends on a dynamic condition.\n","'''"]}]}
