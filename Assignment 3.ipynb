This makes them ideal for processing large datasets or infinite sequences.\n","\n","    How they are defined:\n","      Generators are defined like regular functions, but instead of using the return statement to send back a final result, they use the yield statement to produce a sequence of values.

Generators produce items one by one, on demand. They don't store the entire sequence in memory, which is crucial when dealing with very large or infinite sequences. Regular functions that return lists would load everything into memory at once, potentially causing MemoryError for large datasets.\n","\n","      b.Performance Improvement:\n","          Because they generate values lazily, generators can start processing data before the entire sequence is computed, leading to better perceived performance for large operations.\n","\n","      c.Readability and Simplicity:\n","          Generator functions often look like regular functions, making them easy to write and understand, especially for complex iteration patterns.

You can chain multiple generator functions together, where the output of one generator feeds into the input of another, creating a highly efficient and readable data flow.\n","\n","      e.State Retention:\n","          Generators automatically handle the saving and restoring of their internal state between yield calls, eliminating the need for explicit state management in your code.\n","'''"],"metadata":{"id":"8RjFpPIwr521"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["'''\n","8.
